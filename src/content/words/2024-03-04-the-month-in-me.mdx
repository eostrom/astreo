I played a lot of games last month.

## arts

I also played a lot of electric guitar, accompanying Bummertown at [HUGE Theater][huge].
Back in 2018 I tried to do this show with a keyboard, the instrument I'm proficient in,
but everything I played felt too... well, too much like music. It was while watching
Jill Bernard's Drum Machine that I started to daydream about playing the show on guitar.
Using an instrument I'm less familiar with forced me to simplify, to focus on atmosphere
and mood. I love it, and I loved going back to it this year.

I don't have any [shows coming up](/arts/shows) until May, but it'll be a busy summer!
I was already preparing to return to two of my favorite groups, Two's Company and
[THE PAiNTERS][painters], and this month I was cast in Family Funeral. It's an
improvised drama that hasn't been mounted in almost ten years – I saw it when I was
just figuring out how to watch improv, never mind doing it. I'm honored
and excited and a bit frightened by the chance to perform in this show.

## code

At the end of February I finished a coding task I started in 2021. It should have been easy, but
was made hard by a previous choice. So before I could do the easy thing, I had
to do a harder thing, revising a bunch of code we'd previously written. And before I
could do the harder thing, I had to do a harder thing than that: _deciding we'd been wrong._

Sometimes we get invested in our choices, and it's hard to reverse them, even as begin to hazily
understand that they're making our lives worse. It was a mistake, but it was _our_ mistake!

## life

I semi-accidentally went to two tabletop gaming conventions in one month: [2D Con Unplugged][2dcu]
and [Con of the North.][cotn] This was a big shift from zero such events in the first
three decades of my adult life, but, you see, I wanted to play more games.

They were very different – for example, in how they organized play. Con of the North sent me
a link to a list of hundreds if not thousands of pre-planned gaming sessions: which game was
to be played at which time on which day at which table in which of dozens of rooms. Confronted
with this, I scrolled through the list for a while trying to guess what games would be fun
from their names alone, then blacked out. It took me a few weeks to muster up the courage
to go back and make a plan.

In contrast, 2D Con Unplugged was like, _I don't know, man, it's a big room full of games.
Go nuts!_

I had fun at both. Some favorite games:

- [Moonrakers], a deck-building negotiation game about space contractors
- [The Red Dragon Inn], a very silly card game about adventurers getting drunk
- [Once Upon a Time], a freeform storytelling card game
- [Decorum], "a game of passive-aggressive cohabitation"
- [Electric Bastionland], a low-rules, high-creativity surreal RPG

The best games are the ones you play in good company. I played these games with strangers I hope to meet again.

## onward

March looks pretty low-key – no performances, no big projects – until my now-annual pilgrimage
to the [Big Ears Festival] to get my mind blown.
