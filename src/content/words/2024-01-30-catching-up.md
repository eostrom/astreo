It's been four years since [my last "what's new" post][2019-in-me]. The longer I didn't write,
the more daunting it felt to try to cover everything that had happened. (Short version:
Like many of you, I experienced a global pandemic.)

But this month, after resurrecting my blog to write [about some songs][2023-songs],
I ran across a [weekly post from mid-2019][2019-then] that resonated, and I thought, well, maybe
instead of trying to write about everything that's happened since then, I could just
do a quick then-and-now compare-and-contrast. Here we go.

## arts

In 2019, the big news in my arts community was that [HUGE Theater,][huge] my
beloved second home, was buying a building. Well... we didn't. But then we did!
Last fall HUGE had its first shows in its [new building,][new-huge]
just a few blocks up Lyndale Avenue. [_Donations **still very welcome**._][give-huge]
Buildings are expensive!

- Bummertown, the show I was rehearsing in June 2019, is back! "Comedic
  improv that isn't afraid of sadness," I wrote back then. For this show
  I play the electric guitar. Thursdays through February.
  [Tickets here.][bummertown-tix]
- In summer 2019 I was in the middle of a run with [THE PAiNTERS][painters],
  an improv group that paints pictures with words. We're coming back again this
  summer! And for one night in March. More info on [my shows page.](/arts/shows/)
- (I didn't mention Chris Rodriguez in that 2019 post, possibly because I'd only
  met him a couple of times, but now we have a full-fledged duo, and we're also
  doing a run this summer! It's called Two's Company and I love it so much.)

I've been playing live a lot but not recording much. I did finally release a soundtrack
to <cite>The Last Bombardment</cite>, the first play I did with Oncoming Productions.
It's available, alongside even older recordings, [on Bandcamp.][zonky-flay-bandcamp]

## code

- In 2019 I was trying to shift my focus from full-stack Rails
  work to front-end development. I succeeded.
- I've been working with [Livefront][] and it's been good.
- I'm also the lead developer for [SwagLeft][] and I'm proud.
- I just rebuilt [this site](/) in [Astro] and it was fun.

## life

"Minneapolis in the summer," I wrote that summer, "is pretty great."
Winter is a tougher sell, but this one's been easy, and last weekend
I biked around to [Modern Times,][modern-times] the [Trylon Cinema,][trylon]
[Drone Not Drones,][drones] the [Art Shanty Projects,][shanties]
and three nights of shows at HUGE. Okay: Minneapolis in the winter
is pretty great.

Some of my friends are sad because this warm winter is a symptom of
global climate catastrophe, and some of them are sad because they
genuinely enjoy winter activities (and/or being snowed in), but I'm
content because my car got stolen this fall and I decided not to replace it.
Give me one winter I can bike through. We can go back to months of snow and
ice and brutal cold next year.

In summer 2019 I was looking forward to spending the weekend at
[CONvergence,][convergence] a science fiction and fantasy convention in
downtown Minneapolis where "I always feel a bit out of place," but
"I'm always glad I went." Today I'm looking forward to spending two
weekends at tabletop gaming conventions in the suburbs, where I will
definitely feel out of place. Will I be glad I went? I'll let you know
in 2028.
